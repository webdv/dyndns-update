The goal of this script was to make it easy to update your dyndns.com ip address.

Possible in the future if I feel the need to be able to explicitly define the ip, hostname, etc, I may include the optparse module.

As a side note I created this specifically for my iPhone 3GS so it is testing and working on there.

If you use this script, you must read the README file.
